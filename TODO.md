## GitHub
- Upload to Github and Ignore main
    - Have a simple quick one window example
    - The current one is the example of a more complex example

- Error with center print windows and live input
- Use main as an example program, so make it look nice
- Include makefile sample
- Include README.md with all of this and with explanation of classes, explain that this class is dynamic
- Implement a backspace function in the window, other key movement functionality such as arrow keys
- Put a C++ mutex in the UI for future compatiblity with multithreaded applications
    - Marketing will be "A thread-safe UI library built with ncurses"
- Update all documentation to pay tribute to where this came from, but ultimately give it its own feel
- Redo to use camelCaseNaming
- Have the live_input ignore non-printables and return (int) char = 0
- Implement a window history and be able to scroll up and down with it one line at a time via function calls
- Checks if window title is too long for window's witdth
- Ways to Hide the dependency code or organize it out of view?

- Add Github Repo description.
- Uppercase / lowercasing of the title?

- Functionality entirely listed in README.md
